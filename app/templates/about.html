		<h2><em>Introduction</em></h2>
		<br>
		<h4><em>What is the Problem?</em></h4>
		<p>Magic the Gathering is a physical, and digital (came out at a later date), trading card game that pioneered this entire genre back in 1993 when it came out. It continues to thrive with millions of active players worldwide. With the age of the product though, comes the constant need for refreshment with the creation of new cards, game-modes, expansions containing hundreds of cards, and more. Due to that, nowadays, the game has over 16000 cards available and more than 70 card expansions. As a player, it is nigh impossible to pick out the cards you want for your deck, without being able to narrow down the search. The service we are creating would do just that.</p>

		<h4><em>Use Cases</em></h4>
		<p>There are many use cases for such a database among players. Perhaps a player is looking for a specific card to put in their deck, but is unsure of what that card does, in which case a user can look for that card in our database to read up on its characteristics. Alternatively, Magic has many formats of play, and some of them can only make use of specific card sets. Standard format, the most popular, only allows players to build decks with the 2 most recent years of expansion releases. A player attempting to make standard a standard deck would look for cards among the sets that are permitted in that format by filtering our cards based on the sets they belong to. Some players specifically want cards that match an artstyle they like or just collect cards they think are pretty. In this case, a player would be able to look on our artist table and view which cards they worked on. Lastly, players could be trying to make Tribal decks, which look for cards of specific subtypes with the purpose of synergizing their effects. A user would then be able to visit our subtype table, and check out cards filtered by subtype, additionally, if they don’t even know which subtype they want to pick for a deck, there will be example cards of those subtypes available for users to view.</p>

		<h4><em>Database Models</em></h4>
		<p><b>MCard</b> - The model for a Card, it includes the attributes: cardID, name, mainType, subType, text, expansionSet, manaCost, color, power, toughness, art, rarity, and artist. This model contains information pertaining to sets, which in turn, are like containers upon which cards are released in MtG. Sets are a very helpful way to distinguish cards from each other.</p>
		<p><b>MSet</b> - The model for a set, it includes the attributes: code, name, rDate, block, cards, numCards, symbol. The cards attribute is a relationship. Any time a card is instantiated to the database, a relationship is established between a set and any cards that are in that set. This model contains information pertaining to sets, which in turn, are like containers upon which cards are released in MtG. Sets are a very helpful way to distinguish cards from each other.</p>
		<p><b>MArtist</b> - The model for an artist, it includes the attributes: name, numCards, numSets, and cards. The cards attribute is a relationship. Any time a card is instantiated to the database, a relationship is established between an artist and any cards that the particular artist designed. This model  serves as another method for a user to distinguish cards, as many cards could have been worked on by a specific artist.</p>
		<p><b>MSubtype</b> - The model for a subtype, it includes the attributes: name, numCards, sets, and cards. Any time a card is instantiated to the database, if that card has a valid subtype, a relationship is established between that subtype and any cards that share the same subtype attribute. Cards that have similar subtypes often synergize their effects, so it is important to be able to select subtypes of interest and view all related cards. This model is related to the MCard and MSet models.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><em>Relations<em></h4>
		<p>[MCard] many-to-many [MSubtype]
		[MCard] many-to-one [MSet]<br>
		[MCard] many-to-one [MArtist]<br><br>
		[MSet] many-to-many [MArtist]<br>

		<h2>API</h2>
		<br>
		<p>The Magic: The Gathering API we are using is structured in a way that allows for easy searching through cards and sets and works with a variety of parameters. The database is grouped into four pillars: Cards, Sets, Subtypes, and Artists </p>

		<p><u>Cards</u> is self explanatory and denotes the cards available in the game. Each card has a variety of parameters:</p>
		<p><u>name:</u> The card name. For split, double-faced and flip cards, just the name of one side of the card. Basically each ‘sub-card’ has its own record.</p>
		<p><u>manaCost:</u> Converted mana cost. Always a number.</p>
		<p><u>colors:</u> The card colors. Usually this is derived from the casting cost, but some cards are special (like the back of dual sided cards and Ghostfire).</p>
		<p><u>subtypes:</u> The subtypes of the card. These appear to the right of the dash in a card type. Usually each word is its own subtype. Example values: Trap, Arcane, Equipment, Aura, Human, Rat, Squirrel, etc.</p>
		<p><u>supertypes:</u> The supertypes of the card. These appear to the far left of the card type. Example values: Basic, Legendary, Snow, World, Ongoing</p>
		<p><u>types:</u> The types of the card. These appear to the left of the dash in a card type. Example values: Instant, Sorcery, Artifact, Creature, Enchantment, Land, Planeswalker</p>
		<p><u>subtypes:</u> The subtypes of the card. These appear to the right of the dash in a card type. Usually each word is its own subtype. Example values: Trap, Arcane, Equipment, Aura, Human, Rat, Squirrel, etc.</p>
		<p><u>rarity:</u> The rarity of the card. Examples: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Mythic Rare, Special, Basic Land</p>
		<p><u>art:</u> URL link to the image of the card</p>
		<p><u>expansionSet:</u> The set the card belongs to (set code).</p>
		<p><u>text:</u> The flavor text of the card.</p>
		<p><u>artist:</u> The artist of the card.</p>
		<p><u>cardId:</u> A unique id for this card. It is made up by doing an SHA1 hash of setCode + cardName + cardImageName </p>
		<p><u>power:</u> The power of the card. This is only present for creatures. This is a string, not an integer, because some cards have powers like: “1+*”</p>
		<p><u>toughness:</u> The toughness of the card. This is only present for creatures. This is a string, not an integer, because some cards have toughness like: “1+*”</p>
		<p><u>mainType</u>Primary Type of the Card</p>

		<p>The database has two GET methods for searching through cards: GET All Cards and Get a Specific Card. Get All Cards returns a list of the cardId’s for all of the cards in the database. GET a Specific Card will retrieve a specific card from the database by its cardId in the form of a dictionary containing all of the parameters listed above as keys and values.</p>
		<p><u>Sets</u> denotes a group of cards that were released at the same time by the developer and were designed to be played in the same environment. Being able to search for cards by set and see what cards are contained in a specific set is an important part of the knowledge of the game.<br>
		Set has nine parameters:</p>
		<p><u>code:</u> ID by which expansions can be identified</p>
		<p><u>Name:</u> The name of the expansion</p>
		<p><u>rDate:</u> Release date of the expansion</p>
		<p><u>block:</u> Block that the expansion belongs to</p>
		<p><u>cards:</u> List of cards from this expansion</p>
		<p><u>subTypes:</u> List of all subtypes in the expansion</p>
		<p><u>numCards:</u> Number of cards that came out in the expansion</p>
		<p><u>symbol:</u> Symbol used to identify the expansion on cards</p>
		<p><u>artists:</u> List of artists that made cards for this expansion</p>

		<p>The database has two GET methods for searching through sets: GET all sets, which returns a list of all of the set codes for every set in the game. GET a specific set, which takes a set code and returns a dictionary representing the set with each of the parameters listed above as keys and values.</p>
		<p><u>Subtypes</u> denotes the different types or classes for each card. <i>Subtype</i> is a characteristic of a card. Every card has a card type and may have one or more subtypes.<br> Subypes has five parameters</p>
		<p><u>name:</u> Name of the subtype</p>
		<p><u>numCards:</u> Number of existing cards of this subtype</p>
		<p><u>cards:</u> list of cards that are of this subtype</p>
		<p><u>sets:</u> list of sets that contain cards of this subtype</p>

		<p>The database has one GET method for searching through subtypes: GET All Subtypes, which returns a list of dictionaries representing every subtype in the game with all of the above parameters as keys and values. </p>
		<p><u>Aritsts</u> denotes the wide variety of community artists that the creators and producers of the game have employed to produce the incredible art depicted on their cards and sets.<br>Artists has five parameters:</p>
		<p><u>name:</u> Name of the artist</p>
		<p><u>numCards:</u> Number of cards this artist has worked on</p>
		<p><u>numSets:</u> Number of Sets this artist has contributed to</p>
		<p><u>cards:</u> List of all cards that this artist has worked on</p>
		<p><u>sets:</u> List of all sets that this artist has contributed to</p>
		<p>The database has one GET method for searching through artists: GET All Artists, which returns a list of dictionaries representing every artist in the game with all of the above parameters as keys and values.</p>

		<h4><em>Search Capability</em></h4>
		<p>We were originally going to use Flask libraries to aid us in searching the database for whatever the user queried; however, we ran into difficulties trying to get it to work. So, in the end we found it in our best interests to manually iterate over the models of the database and to use Python libraries to filter through the data. Thankfully, this method turned out to be fairly efficient both in programming time and run-time. We found it efficient in order to separate search results by models. It gives results very quickly and generally speaking, if someone is looking for a particular item, it would be easier to specify whether it was a card, a set, a subtype, or an artist. Separating the models also prevents confusion in the cards, subtypes, and artists that all share the same image. </p>

	</div>

	<div id="tools-sec" class="about-section">
		<h2>Tools</h2>
		<br>
		<h4><em>Front End</em></h4>
		<p><u>Bootstrap</u>- Bootstrap is a popular framework for the front-end aspect of web projects. It facilitates design by providing various pre-designed, responsive HTML elements such as buttons, menus, navigation bars, search bars, input boxes and more. The CSS classes included with Bootstrap work with the HTML elements to facilitate the creation of a sleek, customizable interface for a website.</p>

		<p><u>jQuery</u>- jQuery is a small and powerful JavaScript library that simplifies tasks like HTML DOM traversal, HTML DOM editing, and event handling much simpler. jQuery is used with Bootstrap to help create a smooth front-end to a web project.</p>

		<p><u>React JS</u>- React JS is a JavaScript development framework for facilitating the development of front-end web projects. It is an open-source project maintained by Facebook, Instagram and individual developers. It is good for creating large web applications with data that changes over time.</p>

		<p><u>Angular 2</u>- Angular 2 is a development platform for building responsive web applications using TypeScript or JavaScript. It facilitates the use of TypeScript or JavaScript by organizing the code into manageable components.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><em>Back End</em></h4>
		<p><u>Flask</u>- Flask is a framework for Python based on Werkzeug and Jinja 2. It can be used for implementing Python code and designing templates. We mostly used Flask in setting up the link routes to the different pages and rendering the templates for the different HTML pages. Flask also worked in tandem with Jinja 2.</p>

		<p><u>Jinja 2</u>- Jinja 2 allowed us to work simultaneously with flask especially when it came with the base templates, and passing in variables to the templates at runtime. It allows us to mix the html code and backend python to provide a seamless customizable user experience. In particular it eased the process of iterating through large amounts of data, such as the database models. We could dynamically read from the models in the database, and then pass the variables into the html code and render the individual unique pages.</p>

		<p><u>SQLAlchemy</u>- SQLAlchemy is used in the back-end to provide the tools for table creation. Our models, their attributes, and relations are all represented together. SQLALchemy also provides a lot of useful tools for the representation of relations. Several of our models have many-to-many relations with each  other. This means that with the creation of a joint table we can accurately represent that.</p>

		<p><u>Google Cloud Platform</u>- The Google Cloud Platform is a means of hosting our website. It provides the ability to create and edit a website in the cloud. The details of the hosting are described in the “Hosting” section below. It also hosts our cloud database that we read and write from in order to populate the instances of our models. We are able to host on individual computers by whitelisting IP’s for our database instance. In order to deploy to the cloud, we set up a CloudSQL proxy on Nestor’s computer so that the cloud data can link with the local code. After deploying from the proxy server, the database is linked and any changes we make to the data are added dynamically. Different methods were tried in the attempt to host and link the database. After many attempts, we were able to find something that worked both locally and in the cloud.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><em>Embedding-Media Services</em></h4>
		<p>To embed media into the website, we will use Bootstrap and Angular 2, as described in the “Front End” subsection of “Tools”. The Bootstrap library includes features to allow for simple media embedding. The React JS framework include features to allow for simple media embedding. React JS provides a smooth JavaScript interface to abstract away some of the difficulties of programming in plain JavaScript. Bootstrap is used to make the embedded media aesthetically pleasing.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><em>Communication/Other</em></h4>
		<p><u>GitHub</u>- GitHub is used for version control for our project. Every member of our group pushed to the same public GitHub repository, to bring the entire project together, even when we were working separately or remotely. If there is ever an issue with an update to the code, rolling back to an old version is simple and quick. When one member makes a change, other members can easily see what code was removed or added, so we could pick up where someone else left off. Another helpful tool GitHub provides is the Issue Tracker. It’s an easy way to see what tasks need to be done, as well as keep track of bugs that need to be fixed.</p>

		<p><u>Slack</u>- We used Slack as our main method of communication. It has a web and mobile application that we used to coordinate meeting times, and share pictures, information, and anything else we needed to communicate quickly with the group. Slack is integrated with the GitHub repo so in between personal communication we could all see when commits or issues were created.</p>

		<p><u>JSON</u>- JSON is a lightweight data format that makes it easier for people to read and very useful for computers to parse information. Given our project’s immense amount of data, we had to create JSON caches for data to be accessible in a timely manner as well as gather information that was missing from the API. These come in the form of the following:</p>
		<ul>
  		  <li><b>logo.json</b>- This JSON file contains the promotional art for the names of each expansion set. Some sets have no promotional art and are given a default “Magic: the Gathering” image.</li>
				<li><b>artistCache.json</b>- This JSON file contains information regarding all of the artists and their attributes. Given that artists are not considered their own models by the API, we had to gather information on them based on each card they worked on and then each set those cards appeared in.</li>
				<li><b>cardCache.json</b>- This JSON file contains all information regarding cards. The API provided provided a JSON source, but that lacked card image information, so we had to scrape the API to create this one.</li>
				<li><b>setCache.json</b>- This file contains all information regarding sets and had to be created to accommodate for the extra information we wanted to use (f.e.: the promo art in logo.json).</li>
				<li><b>stypeCache.json</b>- Like artists, Subtypes were not treated separately from Sets and Cards in the API, thus we also had to aggregate the data for them manually into this JSON file, which contains all relevant information regarding them.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Hosting</h2>
		<br>
		<h4><em>First Steps</em></h4>
		<p>The first step was to decide which server to use. In our case, we decided to use the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) server simply because it was easier to understand and slightly more inexpensive than the Amazon Web Services (AWS) server. Initially we planned on using the AWS server because it seemed to be the most popular choice, but the tutorials provided were not as easy to follow as those provided by GCP. Also, having received a one-hundred dollar coupon from Google as incentive to use their servers, we felt that using GCP was the way to go.</p>
		<p>To begin hosting our web app on the GCP server, we first signed up using a gmail account. We initially made the mistake of linking our GCP to one of our university emails and could not create any projects, so we had to create a new account and link it to one of our personal gmails. Once we had created an account, we opened the “console,” which is where you monitor and view information regarding your web app project, and looked over some of the tutorials provided.</p>
		<br>
		<h4><em>Google SDK</em></h4>
		<p>After having created an account and looked over some tutorials, we went on to create a new project. Having created a new project inside the console, we moved on to the hosting process and downloaded the Google Cloud SDK. The SDK, which is a set of tools allowing you to access various services in the Google Cloud Platform, would later allow us to deploy, browse, and do other things to our app. We then created a new directory (inside the same directory in which the SDK directory was located) and named it the same name as our Project-ID, as required. We followed a sample directory structure provided by Google’s “Hosting a static website on Google App engine” guide, and included all the files needed to deploy our web app. </p>
		<br>
		<h4><em>Project-ID Directory</em></h4>
		<p>In the first phase of our project, we tried to do all of our app routing through the app.yaml file as described below (We later migrated and refactored our code so that we could use flask instead):</p>
		<p>One file in particular, the “app.yaml” file, required us to do quite some research. This file works as a sort of “makefile” and maps URLs to your static files so the web app can be displayed on your browser, therefore making sure it was properly implemented was extremely important. Also, along with the .yaml file we had our .html, .css, and image files in there respective folders so we made sure that every time something was added, deleted or moved, the .yaml file was updated. </p>
		<p>As mentioned, we later changed our project to use flask instead. This was  a much easier implementation of the mapping process because individual routes could be mapped. It also allowed us to be able to dynamically map the routing to different names based on a single template. We changed our app.yaml file to just run this python script instead. Using flask also allowed us to start a server locally and test our code without having to deploy to the server. This is useful because all of the flask specific things don’t get run until the server starts.</p>

		<h4><em>Deploying the App</em></h4>
		<p>Now that we had created our project inside the console, installed the SDK, and placed our web app inside the &ltProject-ID> directory, we were ready to deploy and successfully host our app using the GCP server. To do just that, we had to go into the “bin” folder of our SDK directory and run the “gcloud app deploy &ltpath to app.yaml file> app.yaml” command. Having deployed successfully, we then ran the “gcloud app browse” command and a new window displaying our app popped up. We had finally completed our hosting process and our app was now online.</p>
		<p>In the second phase of our project, we changed the runtime environment from a standard python 2.7 environment to a flexible python 3.5 environment. This fixed a major bug we were having with pyscopg2, probably because of a compatibility error between python 2.7 and python 3.5. It increased the time it took for us to deploy, which made it even more crucial that we got flask running properly.</p>

		<h4><em>Custom Domain</em></h4>
		<p>In addition, after completing our hosting process, we wanted to link our web app to a custom domain. To accomplish this we used <i>Namecheap</i>’s free educational bundle and acquired the <i>magicdb.me</i> domain. Next, we went over to our console’s settings and added and verified our new domain. Once verified, we added all of the custom domain records to <i>namecheap</i> and waited for a few hours for the linkage to complete. Having completed this process, we were finally able to browse for our website under the <i>magicdb.me</i> URL.</p>
